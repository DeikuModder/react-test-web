### This is a informative blog!

This is my first webpage made with React, just wanted to do something while i was learning about React, and bunch of other front end technologies, so i've made this to not only write my notes on some of the things i learned, but to put them to the test as well, i'm very proud with the result

### Features 

This webpage counts with:
    -Dark mode (wich remains the same wether the user closed the page or not)
    -Displayable menu
    -Toasts
    -A counter example using hooks


### What i learned 

With this project i learned a lot of stuff, the list is:

    - Learned how to use node.js, and therefore install, uninstall and manage dependencies with the 'npm' command
    - Develop a React website from scratch
    - Learned the basic concepts of React (components, props, states)
    - How to use hooks and make custom hooks
    - Use of the local storage
    - Basics of SASS
    - Learned about github pages
    - How to build and deploy a website


### Bugs 

There's one bug, and another that is debatable if it's a bug or not

The first one being that the toast duplicates slightly if the user pass the cursor over the buttons fast, kind of a messy behavior.

And the second one being that the displayable menu stays displayed after the user presses to go to one the sections, as i said, this may not be a problem for some people, it's just that i don't like it lmao

### Documentation

These are the videos and docs that helped me understand the libraries i used for this page

-Video for the local storage and custom hooks [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uutiLsX5kFE&t=438s]
-Video on how to build and deploy a page and upload it to gh pages [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUsC13AEiUQ&t=275s]
-Information on the basics of React [https://es.react.dev]
-Information on the basics of SASS [https://sass-lang.com]
-Docs about the Toasts [https://react-hot-toast.com]

### NOTES/IMPORTANT

I've made this webpage only for a test, as the name of the repository says, so i didn't make the mobile and tablet styles for it, so it only works on Desktop devices.


That would be everything, hope you like this little project of React i've made!
